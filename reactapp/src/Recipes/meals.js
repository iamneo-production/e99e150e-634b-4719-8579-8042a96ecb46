         <h1 className="recipe">Lemon Chicken</h1>
         <h2>Ingredients</h2>
         <p>
         3 to 4 pounds chicken parts (thighs and legs recommended), skin-on, bone-in, trimmed of excess fat
4 teaspoons lemon zest (about zest from 2 lemons)
1/3 cup lemon juice
2 cloves garlic, crushed
2 tablespoons fresh chopped thyme (or 2 teaspoons dried)
2 teaspoons fresh chopped rosemary (or 1/2 teaspoon dried)
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1 teaspoon black pepper
2 tablespoons butter, melted
Lemon slices for garnish
         </p>
         <h2>Cooking Technique and Tips</h2>
         <p>Place lemon juice, lemon zest, garlic, thyme, rosemary, salt, and pepper in a large, non-reactive bowl, whisk to combine.

With the tip of a sharp knife, cut into the underside (skinless) of each chicken piece one or two times by about 1/2 an inch. (This will help the marinade penetrate.)

Place the chicken pieces in the bowl and turn to coat with the marinade. Place in the refrigerator and marinate for 1 to 2 hours. Pour the juices from the pan into a serving bowl. Use a tablespoon to skim the fat off the top (save the fat for cooking with later, or discard, but do not discard down the drain or it will solidify and clog your drain).

Serve the chicken with the juices on the side or a little poured over the top of the chicken.

Serve alone, or with steamed rice, buttered noodles, angel hair pasta, or mashed potatoes.</p>
