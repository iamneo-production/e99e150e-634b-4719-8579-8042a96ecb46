Grind it into a thick paste. The paste will be dark brown in colour.

Check salt, adjust and mix well.

Smear every seer fish steak with this spicy paste on both sides. Be generous while smearing the paste. Let it be thick to achieve the spicy Chettinad effect.

Marinate these steaks for at least 20 minutes.
